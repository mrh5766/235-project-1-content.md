                    The graphics style will be pixel art. It will have 8-bit music, and will have sounds to indicate
                    shooting and the boss's abilities.

                    The player can shoot and move to avoid boss abilities. For controls, the player can move using the
                    wasd keys, and aim and shoot using the mouse. The player is taught the controls in a
                    tutorial screen before the game starts. To beat the game, the player must learn the boss's attacks
                    and how to dodge them. For example, the boss might have an attack where it creates lasers on the
                    screen, with an image showing where the lasers would be beforehand so that the player could dodge.
                    The player will have a temporary boost, such as a shield or a speed boost that will go on
                    cooldown. The cooldown will have a visual indicator.

                <p>I don't really have anything else to say about the game. I'm just trying not to make it too
                    complicated, especially because I know nothing about Javascript yet.</p>

                <h2>About the Developer</h2>
                <p>My name is Michael Hrehocik. I'm a sophomore game design student, and know C#, C++, and Java, and the
                    tools Visual Studio and Unity. I'm interested in programming, rather than any sort of creative
                    elements such as visual or sound design, since I'm not a creative person. However, I still enjoy
                    programming games.
